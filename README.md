## How to Use

1. Open your Commerce Cloud project in VS Code.
2. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac).
3. Search for **DW Environment Switcher** commands.
4. Select or create sandbox environments, choose cartridges, or switch code versions easily.

### Switching Code Version

Use `Switch Current Sandbox Code Version` command to:

- Quickly change the `code-version` for your current sandbox (`dw.json`).
- Automatically update `dw-envs.json` if the sandbox exists there.

No need to reselect hostname or username — just pick or enter the new code version.

---

### Export Setup

- Use `Export Sandbox Setup` to save your environment into a zip file.
- Exports `dw.json`, `dw-envs.json`, and global state (credentials, hostnames, usernames, code versions).
- Useful for backups or transferring environments between machines.

### Import Setup

- Use `Import Sandbox Setup` to restore sandbox configurations.
- Select the exported zip file and the extension will apply the configurations to your current workspace.

## Cartridge Selection

When configuring or switching sandboxes (using `Select Sandbox with Details`):

1. Choose **Yes** when prompted to select cartridges.
2. The extension lists valid cartridges from the workspace (folders with `.project` and `cartridges` folder).
3. Pick cartridges to associate with the sandbox. These will be added to `dw.json`.

---

## Requirements

- VS Code with Prophet Debugger installed.
- Project folder with `dw.json` and/or `dw-envs.json` (automatically created if missing).
- Node.js installed locally (VS Code extension dependencies only).
