## About

This extension is specifically built to enhance the development experience when using the **Prophet Debugger** (Salesforce Commerce Cloud) inside Visual Studio Code.

It helps you manage multiple Salesforce sandbox environments and switch between them easily, without manually editing `dw.json`. Additionally, it allows you to **select cartridges** dynamically for your Salesforce Commerce Cloud projects. The extension also includes **Export** and **Import** functionality, making it easy to transfer configurations between different computers.
